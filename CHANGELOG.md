# Musicoin Desktop Wallet 0.8

MDW 0.8 comes with a host of new features, including

1. Automatic time sync with remote time server every five seconds: Local time is synced with the network time at 5 second intervals and a warning box pops up notifying the user of the same.

2. Backup Wallet Option: You now can export your UTC file with the click of a button

3. Improved Syncing: Bundled with go-musicoin 2.5.1, the client now syncs faster than ever.

4. UI changes: Basic elements have been moved around to give you the details you need.

You can now click on the Explorer icon to be redirected to explorer.musicoin.org to view the tx log on the chain.

## Upgrading

In order to upgrade to the new version of the Musicoin client, you could replace the application directory (the directory that has the executable). The chain keys are NOT contained within the folder, so there is no worry of having to worry about them getting deleted. However, you MUST backup your keys in order to prevent them from getting lost forever. The Wallet's "Backup Wallet" button is designed to show you where your keys lie.

## Finding Peers

Ideally, you shouldn't have issues finding peers with go-musicoin 2.5.1. However, if you still encounter issues, you can manually add them via the "Add Peers" button on the Wallet.
