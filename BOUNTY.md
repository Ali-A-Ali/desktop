# The Musicoin Bounty Program

## About the Program
Musicoin Desktop Wallet(MDW) is an open source project to support end users to well transfer the currency($MUSIC) between different stops. It's been downloaded more than 40K times since it's first release on Feb. 2017, a big proof that it's a useful and fast-growign tool.

Unfortunately, the focus of core team has to be more on blockchain upgrading, web application development, and mobile/hardware partnership, to make the ecosystem bigger and widely adopted by various stakeholders. This has shifted our focus from MDW to other applications, leading us to introduce this bounty program.

## Guidelines and Instructions

Issues that have a bounty are marked with two different kinds of labels - A Cyan bounty label along with the bounty amount in its respective color. Participants interested in putting in a PR for the same are requested to do so right away, there is no need to claim the issue or request to be assigned towards the same.

Some general guidelines towards the same are:

1. The best proposal wins, not the first one. So you'll have to make sure that your fix stands out from the rest.
2. The Musicoin developers would be happy to assist any person with a given issue, at the official Slack/Discord forums.
3. To claim your bounty, you're required to sign the Musicoin CLA. This will be presented to you after your PR is merged.
4. New bounty issues can be submitted at any time, the team will review and assign a bounty if needed.
5. Teamwork is encouraged. If two people work together to fix an issue, both will be rewarded in proportion to their contribution.
6. General guidelines like DRY and comments are strongly encouraged.

The bounty program is open for all, beginner or experienced - Beginner issues will be labelled with a "good first issue" tag and assigned a small amount of bounty. The bounty amount may increase depending on the difficulty and urgency of the issue presented. All final calls regarding awarding bounty strictly lie within the Musicoin team and will not be subject to discussion.
